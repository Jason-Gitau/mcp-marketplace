# Your Complete MVP Game Plan

## Phase 1: Research & Validation (Weeks 1-2)

### **Week 1: Market Intelligence**
**Goal:** Understand the real landscape of those 5000+ MCP servers

**Tasks:**
- Build a simple script to scrape GitHub for MCP servers (search: "mcp server", "model context protocol")
- Check official MCP repositories and awesome lists
- Join MCP Discord communities, Reddit discussions
- Document the top 20-30 servers by stars/activity
- **Key question to answer:** Are there really 5000 quality servers, or is it mostly forks/abandoned projects?

**Deliverable:** Spreadsheet with top 50 MCP servers + quality metrics (stars, last commit, working status)

### **Week 2: Pain Point Discovery**
**Goal:** Talk to real developers who use MCP servers

**Tasks:**
- Post in MCP communities: "What's your biggest pain point with MCP servers?"
- DM 10+ developers who've built/used MCP servers
- Test 10-15 servers manually - how hard is setup? Do they actually work?
- Document common problems: broken endpoints, poor docs, auth complexity

**Deliverable:** List of validated pain points + evidence that your solution would help

## Phase 2: Build MVP Directory (Weeks 3-4)

### **Week 3: Automated Discovery**
**Goal:** Build scripts that can process MCP servers at scale

**Tasks:**
- Write GitHub API scraper for MCP repositories
- Build health checker that tests if servers respond
- Create metadata extractor (description, capabilities, pricing from README/package.json)
- Set up basic database (Supabase) to store server data

**Deliverable:** Working script that can discover and validate MCP servers automatically

### **Week 4: Directory Website**
**Goal:** Simple, clean website that showcases curated MCP servers

**Features:**
- **Homepage:** Featured servers + search bar
- **Categories:** Productivity, Data, AI, Dev Tools, etc.
- **Server pages:** Description, setup guide, working examples
- **Search/filter:** By category, working status, complexity
- **Submit server:** Form for community to add new ones

**Tech Stack:** Next.js + Supabase (you can build this in 2-3 days with AI help)

**Deliverable:** Live website at `mcpservers.com` or similar

## Phase 3: Launch & Iterate (Weeks 5-8)

### **Week 5: Soft Launch**
**Goal:** Get initial users and feedback

**Tasks:**
- Share in MCP Discord/Reddit communities
- Tweet about it with examples
- Email the developers you talked to in Week 2
- Track: visitors, time on site, which servers get most views

**Target:** 50+ unique visitors, 5+ community submissions

### **Week 6-7: Community Building**
**Goal:** Make it self-sustaining

**Tasks:**
- Add user ratings/reviews for servers
- Create "Server of the Week" content
- Reach out to popular server authors to "claim" their listings
- Add submission queue with simple approval workflow

**Target:** 100+ weekly visitors, 10+ server submissions

### **Week 8: Evaluate & Plan**
**Goal:** Decide if this is worth pursuing further

**Metrics to evaluate:**
- **Traffic:** Are developers returning weekly?
- **Engagement:** Are they using your examples/setup guides?
- **Community:** Are server authors engaging with your platform?
- **Growth:** Is word-of-mouth happening organically?

**Decision point:** If metrics are good, plan Phase 4 (proxy/billing). If not, pivot or try a different approach.

## Phase 4: Evolution (Weeks 9-16) - Only If Phase 3 Works

### **If Directory Shows Traction:**
- Add simple proxy functionality (single endpoint for top 10 servers)
- Implement basic usage tracking
- Test with 3-5 friendly developers
- Add simple payments ($5-10/month for premium features)

## Resource Requirements

### **Time Commitment:**
- **Weeks 1-2:** 10-15 hours/week (research heavy)
- **Weeks 3-4:** 15-20 hours/week (building)
- **Weeks 5-8:** 5-10 hours/week (maintenance + iteration)

**This fits around college classes without overwhelming you.**

### **Financial Investment:**
- **Domain:** $15/year
- **Hosting:** Vercel (free) + Supabase (free tier)
- **Total:** <$100 for entire MVP

### **Skills You'll Learn:**
- API scraping and data processing
- Full-stack web development (Next.js + Supabase)
- Community building and developer relations
- Basic product management and metrics

## Success Criteria for Each Phase

### **Phase 1 Success:**
- You understand the MCP ecosystem deeply
- You've identified 50+ quality servers
- You've talked to 10+ potential users
- You have clear evidence of pain points

### **Phase 2 Success:**
- Working website with 50+ servers
- Automated discovery pipeline working
- Clean, professional presentation
- Basic analytics set up

### **Phase 3 Success:**
- 100+ weekly active users
- 20+ community server submissions
- Positive feedback from developers
- Server authors engaging with your platform

### **Phase 4 Decision Point:**
- If all previous phases succeed → build the full marketplace
- If not → apply learnings to next project

## The College Integration

### **How This Helps Your Studies:**
- **CS coursework:** Database design, web APIs, algorithms (for search/ranking)
- **Math coursework:** Statistics for server rankings, data analysis
- **Projects:** Can use MCP work for class assignments
- **Network:** Professors might connect you with industry contacts

### **Risk Management:**
- **Low time commitment** during exam periods
- **Can pause development** without losing progress
- **Skills transfer** to other projects if this doesn't work
- **Resume builder** regardless of business outcome

## Your Next Action (This Week)

**Spend 2-3 hours this weekend:**
1. Write a simple Python script to search GitHub for MCP servers
2. Pick the top 10 by stars and manually test them
3. Document which ones actually work and what they do

**If you find 10 working servers with clear value props, you're ready to build the directory.**

**If most are broken or unclear, that's valuable data too - maybe the opportunity is building better MCP servers, not organizing existing ones.**

**Ready to start with that GitHub discovery script?** That's your concrete first step.
